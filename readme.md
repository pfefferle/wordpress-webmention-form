## Installation ##

1. Upload the `wordpress-webmention-form`-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress
3. ...and that's it :)

The plugin only works in combination with the [WebMention plugin](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention) for WordPress.

For additional plugins which expand on this type of web functionality/architecture, please try out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/">Indieweb Plugin</a> in the WordPress.org repository and visit <a href="http://indieweb.org">Indieweb.org</a> for additional details.
